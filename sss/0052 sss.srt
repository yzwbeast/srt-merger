Hey guys, welcome to day 52

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,850
of 100 Days of Code. Today

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,970
I've got yet another pretty fun project for you.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,780
It is a Instagram follower bot.

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,920
So here's the thing is. Have you ever felt a little bit lonely?

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:22,020
Have you ever wanted more friends? Well, I can't really get you more friends,

7
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:26,970
but I could figure out a way of getting you more followers on Instagram.

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,640
So recently I was talking to a Instagram consultant.

9
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,200
This is somebody who actually advises businesses and startups on 

10
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,080
how they can build their Instagram presence.

11
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,380
And they've worked with a lot of successful companies.

12
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,200
And one of the secrets that they shared with me,

13
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:51,000
which I thought was really cool actually, is let's say that you are somebody

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,840
who's trying to build a brand around cooking.

15
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:00,350
So you could do is you could look at all the accounts on Instagram that are

16
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,810
already, um, cooking related.

17
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,290
One of my favorite probably to this day is a company called ChefSteps.

18
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:15,300
They just have the coolest content and they have amazing YouTube videos with

19
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:19,320
tutorials. And a lot of the stuff that they make are just gorgeous,

20
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:23,760
like real molecular gastronomy and everything looks amazing.

21
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:29,070
Let's say that you are trying to build a company where it was also doing

22
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:33,720
something that was food related and you want to get more followers for your

23
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,010
company. One of the ways that you could do it is if you think about it,

24
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,040
if you find a company that has a similar demographic or a similar audience to

25
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:43,860
yours,

26
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,200
basically people who like food or people who like cooking, well,

27
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,470
what you could do is you could go to their Instagram account and then look at

28
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,580
their followers.

29
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,930
And then you can go through this list of people who follow ChefSteps and follow

30
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,510
each of these accounts. Now, for a lot of these people,

31
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:07,680
they are small individuals who are just interested in cooking or food.

32
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:12,240
So if you have something that's food related and you're following somebody,

33
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:15,570
then they might notice you as well. And in turn,

34
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:19,380
you'll probably get more followers. So I thought this was a really cool idea

35
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,930
and it's something that's really ripe for automation,

36
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:26,930
because who wants to go through a list of 247,000 people and click on each of

37
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,090
these buttons. Nobody, right?

38
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,350
So we're going to do this using code. More specifically,

39
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:38,970
Selenium and Python. Here's what it looks like when I run my code.

40
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,180
It's gonna log into Instagram automatically

41
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:52,140
and then it's going to go to the account that I want to replicate followers for.

42
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,440
And then it's going to click on that link followers

43
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:00,650
and it's going to start following each of these individual accounts one by one

44
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,610
automatically. And you can see my mouse is nowhere near there.

45
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,463
Yeah.

46
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,280
That's the goal for today. If you're building a business,

47
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,460
if you're building a startup or if you're building your own custom brand,

48
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,010
or if you just want more followers on Instagram,

49
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,590
this might be something that you would be interested in.

50
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:21,570
And it definitely helps you tap into some new skills with Selenium and Python.

51
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,010
So once you're ready,

52
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,370
head over to the next lesson and put your skills to the test.
