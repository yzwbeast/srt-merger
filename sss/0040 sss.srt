Hey guys,

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,840
welcome to day 40 of 100 Days of Code. Today is really exciting because

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,870
we're going to be upgrading the project that we created in the last day

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:17,220
to a fully-fledged product. We're going to be building a company today,

5
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,730
and this is part two of your capstone project.

6
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:26,130
Now the first rule of flight club is you do not talk about flight club.

7
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,410
So in part one, we created our flight deal hunter for ourselves,

8
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:36,300
and we only had a user base of one. Now in this part 2,

9
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,250
we're going to be leveling up the code so that we can start signing up users and

10
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,990
send them an email with a notification of all of the best flight deals.

11
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,940
A little while ago, I discovered a company called Jack's flight club,

12
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,950
and it's pretty simple.

13
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,600
All you have to do is put in your email and then they'll send you cheap flight

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,840
deals. So any flight within the next six months

15
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,120
that is a lot cheaper than it normally is, you'll get it through an email.

16
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,980
And if you're like me, somebody who doesn't really care where they're going

17
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,570
just as long as they're getting a good deal, then these emails are pretty cool,

18
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:16,463
right?

19
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,830
They actually charge for this premium service in order to get an email with all

20
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,630
of the latest deals and all of the best flight prices. Now,

21
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:28,560
if you think about it,

22
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:33,510
their service is essentially the same as what we've created using Python code.

23
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,890
Maybe they'll have a larger Google spreadsheet with more destinations,

24
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,350
but essentially it's pretty much the same.

25
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,100
I want you to take a look at their website, Jack's flight club, and see how it

26
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,940
works and you can see that they've actually got a whole bunch of members,

27
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,970
but this is essentially what we're going to replicate.

28
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,430
By the end of today,

29
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,460
we'll have a text-based way of getting our customers or users to join.

30
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,840
So maybe you've got some friends and family who might want to use your flight

31
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,210
club to get the best flight deals. Well

32
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:13,440
then all you have to do is point them to a link in Repl.it

33
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,880
which contains your customer acquisition code and then they get to, um,

34
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:22,440
enter in their name and email.

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,890
And after a little bit of validation,

36
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,920
we hit enter and we get added to a spreadsheet. In our spreadsheet,

37
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,780
in another sheet called users

38
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,620
we'll see all the details of our customer being added,

39
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,270
and we're going to be using the SMTP module that we learned about a long time

40
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:46,710
ago to email all of our users with the latest deals every day.

41
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,020
So head over to the next lesson and get started by downloading the starting

42
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:52,440
files.
