00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:06,780
Hey guys. In this module I've got something a little bit different for you. Now, 

2
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:13,220
up till now we've been working on how to build websites that have great functionality and how to use

3
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:17,590
CSS, HTML, to build up the structure of the website.

4
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:24,680
Now today I want to talk about something a little bit different namely how to design websites so that

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:30,710
not only does your website have great functionality but it also looks beautiful.

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,910
The most important thing to making a website loved by users is pretty much the design.

7
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:39,010
After all, think about it.

8
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:43,600
When was the last time you heard somebody tell you, "Hey I came across this great website.

9
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,220
It worked really really well.

10
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,180
So smooth and no bugs."

11
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,000
Nobody ever says that right?

12
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:55,050
They say things like: "It looked so beautiful. It just worked like I wanted it to."

13
00:00:55,910 --> 00:01:02,570
So today we're going to talk about design and I want to show you some of the different aspects of design

14
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,450
when it comes to websites.

15
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,340
Now more often than not, you've heard the saying right?

16
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:10,260
"Don't judge a book by its cover."

17
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:16,250
Now at the same time, you might have also heard of this saying: "You only have three seconds to make a

18
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,770
good impression."

19
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,400
Now when it comes to web design, the latter is probably more accurate.

20
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:30,290
It's just like a job interview or a first date, your website has a crucial few seconds before the user

21
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,720
is going to judge your company, your brand, your product.

22
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,820
So take a look at this example.

23
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:43,930
This is a website called Penny juice and it's a company that sells children's juice cartons.

24
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:52,880
Now look at the design of it. There's clashing colors, there's different typefaces, there's different colors

25
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,980
for the text and they have different fonts and it's all, to be honest, a bit of a mess.

26
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:02,300
So this is a question I often ask students at this point.

27
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:08,250
Take a look at this website and ask yourself if you were to buy a product from this company,

28
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:12,200
if you were to buy a carton of juice, how much would you pay for it?

29
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,920
Now take a look at this website.

30
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,990
This is the same website reimagined by a professional web designer.

31
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:28,100
Look at how the color scheme is now consistent, how the fonts and the typefaces now look a lot better.

32
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:34,860
And ask yourself again, how much would you pay for a single carton of juice from this website.

33
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,740
Now I've asked this question to a number of people and this is the result I got.

34
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:46,570
People are willing to pay anywhere up to only a dollar for a carton of juice from the first wesite

35
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:51,150
but anywhere up to $3 for the second website.

36
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:57,480
Now I run a startup and a lot of friends and colleagues of mine also work on their own businesses.

37
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:02,630
And we usually spend a lot of time brainstorming, how can we make our product better,

38
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,930
how do we make our brand stronger.

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,600
And there's very very few things that we can think of that can actually produce a three times improvement

40
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,120
in the value of your product or in the value of your company.

41
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,660
So design is really really powerful.

42
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:24,980
It's one of the cheapest ways to make your company or your product look expensive because it's elevating.

43
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:30,820
And it doesn't take a lot to get good at design as you'll see in the coming lessons.

44
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:36,140
So we're going to be exploring some of the principles of web design in this module.

45
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:44,210
And I want to take you through everything from color theory to typography to user interface design and

46
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,330
user experience design.

47
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:51,020
These are the four pillars of good web design.

48
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:55,220
So once you are ready, head over to the next lesson and let's get started.


49
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:08,520
Now one of the first things I want to talk about is Color Theory. And color theory is the art and science

50
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,760
of creating the right palette for your website.

51
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,040
So take a look at this example.

52
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:21,690
Now let's say you had a logo where you have flowers which are brown, paintball which is pink.

53
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,960
It looks all very weird and very inconsistent.

54
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:30,960
And take a look at the actual logos. Like what are you thinking when you see these color palettes on

55
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,560
the words. The color of the flowers looks a bit like dirt I guess but it also looks a bit like something

56
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,460
else. And the paint ball being pink

57
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,120
I'm not really sure who that target audience is. But take a look at this.

58
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,630
If we flip the color palette, it suddenly all looks like it's meant to be like this.

59
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,710
It suddenly all looks a lot better right?

60
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,940
It looks consistent with the actual message.

61
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,770
So when you're picking colors you have to be aware of the mood of your color palette.

62
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:09,780
So the predominant color that is going to be in your design really tells a story and it conveys a message

63
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,530
to the user.

64
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:20,490
For example, Red conveys love, energy, intensity. Which is why you see a lot of car adverts which have a

65
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,980
red car on a red background.

66
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,250
It's because they're trying to tell you,

67
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,560
"Hey buy this car and you'll feel energetic

68
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:38,220
and the intensity of this car even if you're 89." Now yellow is more about joy, intellect, attention.

69
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:46,290
And the most important thing about yellow though is how attention grabbing it is because it's almost

70
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,550
impossible to not look at something that is very yellow.

71
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,530
For example this ad. Now a few years back

72
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:59,220
this ad caused an uproar because it has this lady in a yellow bikini

73
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,500
and it says, "Are you 

74
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,560
beach body ready?"

75
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,740
And a lot of people got really really upset about it.

76
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,090
They took to the Internet,

77
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,419
they raved about it.

78
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:15,390
And I remember thinking to myself at the time, "You know, this is not so different from a lot of the other

79
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,880
ads that are trying to tell women how to look."

80
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,100
And it's not a great message.

81
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,580
But why is it causing so much anger and causing so much attention drawn to it?

82
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,270
And I think the reason is because it's actually bright yellow.

83
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,450
It's impossible to ignore this advert when you come across it.

84
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:42,420
So when you're creating a logo or when you're creating some sort of headline, then yeah yellow is a great

85
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:48,090
choice. But when you're creating something that's designed to be looked at for a long period of time

86
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:53,290
then yellow can be too attention grabbing. It might actually hurt your user's eyes

87
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,000
if you tried to read a whole article that's backgrounded in yellow.

88
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:05,670
Now the next color that we're going to talk about is green which is all about freshness, growth, safety.

89
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:13,110
And that's why you see a lot of grocery companies like Hello Fresh or Amazon groceries use this color

90
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:19,120
as their predominant color palette. Because it's trying to tell you, "Hey look! This thing is edible.

91
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,620
This is what we're selling."

92
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:28,870
And so if you have a company that has anything to do with food, this is usually a safe bet to go with.

93
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:37,440
Now Blue is about stability, trust, serenity. And so you see a lot of companies which need to convey that

94
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,980
"Hey, we're really trustworthy"

95
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,930
use this color. For example,

96
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:47,640
look at all the financial companies, look at companies like PayPal or the cryptocurrency companies like

97
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,680
Coinbase. They all choose this color because they want you to know that they're not going to run away

98
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,060
with your money.

99
00:03:54,090 --> 00:04:01,170
In fact, there was a really interesting psychology study where they compared interviewees wearing different

100
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,550
colored shirts.

101
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,700
So for example, a group of them would wear a green shirt,

102
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:12,410
another group would wear a blue shirt and they compared how they were perceived by the interviewers.

103
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:19,050
And it showed that just by changing the color of your shirt to a blue one you vastly increase the amount

104
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,180
of trust in you

105
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,970
that's given by other people.

106
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:26,390
So have a think about that the next time you're going for an interview.

107
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:34,950
Now the final color is purple and it's meant to signify royalty, wealth, femininity. And strangely enough

108
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:41,160
I've come across a number of payday loan companies which use this color palette especially ones which

109
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,900
are targeted at women.

110
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:48,690
So, the important thing to think about is that you're making a conscious decision when you're choosing

111
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:49,920
a color palette.

112
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:56,040
It's not just whichever color you like or your favorite color. But it's actually 'what message am I trying

113
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:03,930
to convey to the user' and then picking an appropriate color. Now, usually you're not just going to be

114
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:09,180
using a single color for your design. You're probably going to be using two or three.

115
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:14,850
So at some point you have to think about which different colors to combine.

116
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:19,680
And this is probably the most scientific part of color theory.

117
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:28,740
Now very often, designers will rely on scientific ways of combining colors. For example taking two colors

118
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:31,560
that are right next to each other on the color wheel.

119
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:36,170
And this way you create what's called an analogous color palette.

120
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:42,600
And these designs look incredibly harmonious and they really work well together.

121
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:48,450
So this color palette can be really good for things like navigation bars and the body of your website

122
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:52,300
or things like a logo and it's background.

123
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:59,160
Now, what it's not so good at though is standing out. If you really want your design to pop, you're better

124
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:05,490
off taking two colors from opposite ends of the color wheel creating what's called a complementary color

125
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,280
palette or a clashing palette.

126
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,270
Now this complementary color palette really creates that pop.

127
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,490
And it really brings out each of the colors.

128
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:23,130
So the next time you go to a supermarket, I want you to take a look at the meat aisle and see if they've

129
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:27,910
used this complementary color palette to make things pop.

130
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:34,620
So, one of the things that you often see is they'll take these fake plastic bits of greenery like fake

131
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:42,720
grass or fake bushes and they'll put it in between the meat. And because the green and the red are complementary

132
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:50,160
colors it makes the red meat pop out a lot more and gives you this idea of freshness

133
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:57,750
even if it's a little bit past the best dates. But what you shouldn't do with clashing colors or complementary

134
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:04,710
colors is to try to style text and text background with it because it actually looks very very jarring

135
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,440
and you can feel your eyes sort of getting a little bit fuzzy

136
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:13,940
looking at this particular combination. So don't do this when it concerns text.

137
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:20,670
Instead, keep it to things like logos or icons or things that you really really want to stand out from

138
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:21,990
each other.

139
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:28,350
Now, there's a lot of other ways that you can combine colors like drawing an equilateral triangle to

140
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:34,170
create a triadic color palette or drawing a perfect square.

141
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:40,200
Now if you want to, you can head over to a website called Adobe color which lets you mess around with

142
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:47,430
all of these different color combinations. So select a triadic color palette or a square color palette

143
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:52,990
and then drag it around the color wheel so that you get different combinations of colors.

144
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:59,100
And once you come across a palette that fits the mood of your project, then you can pick the hex codes

145
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:02,790
and just put them straight into your website.

146
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:07,950
Now if all of that sounds like it was a little bit too much work ,then I got you covered.

147
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:11,470
You can also use a website called colorhunt.co.

148
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:17,550
This is a website where professional designers have curated some of their favorite color palettes

149
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:21,130
and you can nab the hex codes straight off the website.

150
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:28,530
So take a look at the hot and popular sections of this website and use it to guide the pilot scheme

151
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,810
for your next project.

152
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:37,350
Now when you create a website that has a beautiful consistent color scheme like the one for the LIEBE

153
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:44,760
yogurt, you can see how much it makes the design stand out and it becomes really colorful and really

154
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:51,000
playful and you can convey different messages using your choice of colors and your color scheme.

155
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:54,060
So think about your color choice and your color palette

156
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:59,760
the next time you design your website to make sure that it is consistent with what your brand is about

157
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:04,140
and what your product is about and it conveys the message you want to convey.


158
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:01,000
All right.

159
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:05,190
The next topic I want to talk about is typography.

160
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,670
Now, I know a lot of students always say to me

161
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,460
"But why do I need to learn about typography?

162
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:14,020
I just open up Word, click the dropdown,

163
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,450
find Times New Roman,

164
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,850
my favorite font.

165
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,770
And then just put that on everything. It's done right?"

166
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,350
Well let's think about this.

167
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,030
Well let's say it's Valentine's Day and you decide that you want to write a letter to your beloved Valentine

168
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,150
and you change the font to something cursive like this.

169
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:35,490
"You'll always be mine."

170
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,530
I don't know if she or he will be

171
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,070
but you have a good chance.

172
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:43,350
Now let's say that you chose the wrong font.

173
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,730
That's a bit of a problem.

174
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:51,040
Not only do I not think your Valentine is going to take very kindly to this,

175
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,230
you might also have the police on your back which is a bit of a problem.

176
00:00:55,650 --> 00:01:03,780
So fonts really do matter and it's important to consider not only their mood but also how to combine

177
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:04,910
different fonts.

178
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:12,180
And it's a really really easy way to make your designs look very professional and really slick. Out of

179
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,520
all of the fonts in the world

180
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:19,020
there's pretty much two large families that you should really know about.

181
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:26,700
One is the Serif family where they have these little feet at the end of their central beams.

182
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:34,380
And the reason why they have these old feet is because the Serif typeface were inspired by the marble

183
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,350
carvings of days of yore.

184
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:44,190
So if you next go out and you take a look at the buildings around you especially if you're in a historical

185
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:51,810
area, take a look at places where they've carved into stone or marble and you'll notice that they also

186
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,560
have these little feet at the end of the central beams.

187
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,100
So why is that?

188
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:03,540
I don't know how many of you carved marble in your spare time but if you did you would know that once

189
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:12,210
you chisel has gone into the Rock and you need to exit your engraving it's actually not possible to

190
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:15,540
create 90 degree angles when you're carving into rock.

191
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:21,310
So this is where the Serif typeface gets their inspiration from.

192
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:27,780
And this is also the reason why when you're choosing a Serif typeface you're making your design look

193
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:34,320
more serious, more authoritative and also a little bit older as well.

194
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:41,550
So it's really good if you're designing something like a letterhead for a legal company or a magazine

195
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,590
for architectural design.

196
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,520
But when we take a look at the big family of Serif typefaces

197
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:55,710
they're actually further subdivided into smaller sub families like Old style, Transitional, Modern and

198
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,310
Slab-Serif.

199
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:05,820
Now the really interesting thing is you can actually tell how old a typeface would look by looking at

200
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:11,370
the difference between the thickest and the thinnest parts of each letter.

201
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,050
So compare the Old Style 'o' versus the Transitional

202
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,720
'o' versus the modern

203
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:23,070
'o'. And look at how that difference between the thickest part of the letter and the thinnest part gets

204
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:28,650
more and more exaggerated as you get towards a more modern font.

205
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:34,920
So if you want something that looks authoritative but modern then maybe you want to go for a modern

206
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:43,980
Serif typeface like Didot. But if you want it to come across as a little bit older, a little bit more aged

207
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:49,890
maybe you have a winery, maybe you want to go for an Old Style Serif instead.

208
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:57,270
Now just as different colors have different moods and emotions, different fonts also have different moods

209
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:02,850
and they also convey a different message to a user depending on which one you choose.

210
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:09,800
So the Serif family generally come across as traditional, stable, respectable, authoritative.

211
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:15,490
These are the words that get thrown around by designers when they're thinking about the Serif typeface.

212
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:20,370
So for example, the next time you go to a magazine rack pick up the Vogue magazine.

213
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:26,480
Take a look at their title and see how it's a modern Serif typeface.

214
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:33,000
It's got hugely exaggerated difference between the thick and thin parts of the lettering and it looks

215
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:36,950
authoritative and it knows what it is talking about.

216
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:43,230
Now on the other hand, if we think about the San-Serifs, they're kind of a different family because instead

217
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:49,290
of having the Serifs or the little feet at the end the central beams, they have perfect right angles.

218
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:56,100
And it's this right angle that makes the San-Serif family look so much more friendly, more approachable,

219
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:59,120
more novel and more contemporary.

220
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:06,120
So for example, you will tend to get words like sensible, simple, straightforward. And this is why a lot

221
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:11,390
of startups love using the San-Serif typeface in their websites.

222
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:18,330
For example, a Humanist typeface which is a subfamily of the San-Serifs. It's something that is known

223
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:25,740
as a highly readable typeface. And in fact, even within the Serifs and the San-Serifs, you will tend to

224
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:32,340
see designers going for the San-Serifs if they want to write body text which needs to be more legible

225
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,920
and more readable.

226
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:42,300
Now within this sub family, there's even differences in terms of legibility and readability.

227
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:49,910
So how easy are the words to read and how pleasant is it to read the letters.

228
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:56,760
There was a really interesting study done by MIT a few years back where they took two groups of users,

229
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:05,190
one they put them into a car which had a dashboard made of a Humanist typeface and the other car had

230
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:13,920
a dashboard which had a Grotesque San-Serif typeface. And what they did is they tracked the pupils of

231
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:21,120
the people who were driving the cars and they tested how long each driver needed to look down at the

232
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:27,840
dashboard before they got enough information from the speedometer or the odometer and before they could

233
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:35,160
come back and look at the road again. And really surprisingly they found that just by changing the font

234
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,330
from a Grotesque San-Serif to a Humanist San-Serif, they could save the drivers somewhere around

235
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:48,370
30 to 40 percent of the time that's required to understand the information.

236
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:54,690
So imagine that car is on a freeway that's driving at 60 miles, 100 miles an hour.

237
00:06:54,750 --> 00:07:00,750
That difference in the amount of time the user needs to look down at the dashboard could be the difference

238
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,670
between life and death.

239
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:07,580
And as designers, we rarely get to make that kind of difference in the world right?

240
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:13,600
So knowing that the Humanist typeface, all of the fonts that belong in that category like Gill Sans,

241
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:21,620
Tahoma, Verdana, these are highly readable and highly legible fonts which you can use in the body types

242
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,220
for example of your sales pitch.

243
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,740
Now, even though we're not saving lives with our sales pitches,

244
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:32,610
if you manage to get the user to read through more of your sales copy then they're probably going to

245
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:36,120
be more convinced and more likely to buy your product

246
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,420
right?

247
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,990
So readability and legibility when you're choosing fonts is incredibly important. And the things that

248
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:49,260
you're looking for in the letters when you're looking for legibility are open shapes and a lot of space

249
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:54,690
between each of the letters and also the forms look unambiguous so they look different

250
00:07:54,690 --> 00:08:00,940
for example here the 'g' and the 9 actually look different on the second line. And finally, varying proportions.

251
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,540
So having an 'O' that's very wide and a '0' that's a bit more narrow so you can actually tell the difference

252
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,340
between the two.

253
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:15,990
Now while we've talked about using fonts it's often that you see people go a bit overboard where they

254
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:22,920
choose 10 fonts in the same design. And that makes your design look very cluttered and very unprofessional.

255
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:26,910
I recommend actually sticking to just two fonts in one design.

256
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:32,580
So if you're making a poster keeping that to two fonts. If you're making a section of your website keeping

257
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:36,559
then again to two fonts. It just looks a lot cleaner and a lot tighter.

258
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:44,190
And when you're combining these two different fonts you want to try to go for similar moods. So find

259
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:48,990
fonts that have a similar mood to each other and also a similar time era.

260
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:53,610
You don't want something that looks ultramodern with something that looks like it's from the days of

261
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,780
yore combined together. It looks a little bit weird.

262
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:59,730
Now the things you want to contrast are the serifness.

263
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:05,190
So for example you on the heading to be a Serif and the body to be a San-Serif or the opposite way

264
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:08,030
round. It just creates more interest in your design.

265
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:14,010
And similarly, you can also create interest by just changing up the weights between the heading and the

266
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:21,150
body. So making the heading really really bold or even using a black typeface and making the body text

267
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:27,660
using something like thin or regular or light. These different weights can create contrast in your design.

268
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:34,850
Now if you don't remember anything from this talk on typefaces, I just want you to look at these six

269
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:42,050
fonts and try to wipe them from your memory because it is very very difficult to make these designs

270
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:46,830
look good unless I guess if you're running a lemonade stand.

271
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:52,940
But if you want to look professional, if you want to look designs, try to use one of the other fonts that

272
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:58,190
we've talked about and try to ignore these ones which are difficult to read and have moods that are

273
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,830
difficult to fit in in a professional setting.

274
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:05,780
The next time you're designing a website think about what typefaces you're going to choose.

275
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:11,750
Think about what you're trying to convey with those typefaces and then pick a font from the San-Serif

276
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,660
or the Serif family and maybe try to combine them

277
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:20,000
so you have a heading that's a San-Serif and a body that's a Serif and try to create contrast in your

278
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,310
designs.

279
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:28,310
So keep this in mind and hopefully they'll make your designs a lot more interesting and a lot more professional.


280
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:07,410
So now that we've talked about some of the fundamentals of design like Color Theory and Typography, the

281
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:11,790
next thing I want to talk about is User Interface Design.

282
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,340
Now take a look at this picture.

283
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:21,200
In most cases, 99% of you would have read "YOUR EYE HERE" first, "then here" then

284
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,360
"Isn't that fascinating?"

285
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,620
So this is just a way that our brains work.

286
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,560
We're always drawn to the bigger bolder square of things.

287
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:39,450
And As designers, we can use this knowledge to define hierarchy. So let's say that you were to write a

288
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,770
birthday invites to Jane.

289
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:48,340
You could write it like this. But all of the information has equal weighting.

290
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:54,060
So as a reader, I have to go through the entire paragraph and I can't just skim through it to get the

291
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,470
important bits.

292
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,300
So it's gonna take me a lot longer

293
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:04,980
right? Now on the other hand if I apply the rules of hierarchy then the most important information gets

294
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:12,420
conveyed over first and I make sure that Jane actually knows whose birthday party it is, where it is

295
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:15,570
and when they should go.

296
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,000
So we can establish hierarchy in a number of ways.

297
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,930
The most obvious is through the use of color.

298
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:29,400
So colors that really pop and stand out and have contrast with that background tend to be used for high

299
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,640
hierarchy.

300
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:37,100
So for example in this case if all the colors were the same, then it feels like they all have equal importance.

301
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:43,110
But on the other hand, if we have something that's very bright very standoutish versus something that's

302
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:50,370
a bit more grade, a bit more muted, then we know exactly where our eyes will go to first.

303
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:56,880
Now if you take a look at this example this is the ASOS website. And their predominant color palette

304
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:03,570
is the sort of gray and white color. But they've really cleverly used their accent tone, this green and

305
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,560
red, to really tell the user what they think you should really look at.

306
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:13,860
And it seems like ASOS really cares that you know that they have an outlet and also that you add your

307
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,250
product to the bag so that they can actually make money off you.

308
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,850
So, in this case, they're using that green accent tone to really pull the eyes to that button and make sure

309
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:30,430
that the user actually completes their transaction. Now in addition to color, you should also think about

310
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:36,460
size because as I said, the bigger items often draw your eyes to it.

311
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:42,740
So, for example, if you look at the Coinbase website which you can use to buy cryptocurrency, we can see

312
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:48,740
the first thing they want to tell you is you can use this website to buy and sell cryptocurrency.

313
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:55,960
Now the next biggest thing on the page is this huge email input and a button that says "Get started".

314
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:02,570
So because a lot of these companies run ads and they're paying for users to land on their page, it's really

315
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:05,630
important for them to capture the emails.

316
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:08,930
This is kind of what this design is representing

317
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:09,760
right?

318
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:15,560
As long as you land on this page, you're probably going to want to look at this place where you put in

319
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:22,380
your email address and get started so that the company can capture your information.

320
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,970
Now in addition to establishing hierarchy in terms of user interface, you should think about the layout

321
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,460
of your website.

322
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:36,710
You can of course, on one hand, have this big block of text which is just your website where everything

323
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:40,040
is all laid out in the same kind of way

324
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:46,970
or you can create more interest by creating a block of text and then interspersed with pictures and

325
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:52,160
then create some different sizes and different shapes and different hierarchies to make your design

326
00:03:52,160 --> 00:04:02,820
look more interesting. Now the Wikipedia pages are a example in bad design because just look at how bland

327
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,300
it looks.

328
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:08,760
It really is trying to be an encyclopedia but it doesn't have to be like this. Now

329
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:15,600
one of the most noticeable things about Wikipedia is just the length of each block of text.

330
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,870
Just look at how long each line of text is.

331
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:24,830
It's very hard for a user to keep their eyes tracking along the same line.

332
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:32,250
And in fact, in terms of user interface design, there's an optimal line length. Too long and it gets a

333
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:38,870
little bit tedious to read. But too short it feels a bit too choppy and it's a bit awkward to read.

334
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:44,940
So you want to aim for something around 40 to 60 characters per line so that it feels comfortable to

335
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:51,910
the user and they'll be able to get through the information and still be interested in your website.

336
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:58,850
Now when you have good layout like Grammarly's website, it's not only interesting but it also chops

337
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:04,880
up the content into smaller pieces so that you actually get through more of the website and you take

338
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,050
more of it in.

339
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,610
Now another thing I want to talk about is alignment.

340
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:17,360
This has to do with how you position each of the elements on the screen relative to each other.

341
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:24,200
So take a look at the example on the left. The top title is center-aligned whereas the body text is

342
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:30,370
left-aligned. And it makes it look a little bit awkward like they're not really meant to be together.

343
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:38,000
Now on the right however just by shifting the alignment so that both starting points are the same for

344
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,410
the title and the body, it suddenly looks a lot more consistent and a lot more designed.

345
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:50,960
Now one of the easiest ways of making any sort of design you create look professional is just to reduce

346
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,780
the number of alignment points.

347
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:59,840
So let's say that you're creating a slide deck for your next presentation or you're creating a poster

348
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,680
for your birthday party,

349
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:09,290
take a look at all the things that are on the design and identify a line which goes through the beginning

350
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,870
of each item.

351
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:17,240
Now if you can reduce the number of lines like we have done here on the right then suddenly the design

352
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,490
looks a lot more coherent like all the pieces are meant to be together.

353
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,100
And it just looks a lot more professional.

354
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:31,400
So use these grid lines in your designed to help you visualize where the starting points of each element

355
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,490
is and try to line them all up.

356
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:40,490
Because even if you do nothing else but just alignment, you can see in this case the left looks a lot

357
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:47,780
more sloppy and the right looks a lot more designed and more professional. And all that's changed, there's

358
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:54,950
no change in the color, there's no change in typography, it's just the alignment. Now a really important

359
00:06:54,950 --> 00:07:03,630
concept in all design is White Space. And white space refers to the empty space that's around text or round

360
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,210
your elements.

361
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:12,230
Now sometimes when I'm on the high street I come across one of these luxury handbag or shoe shops and

362
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,580
I look through the window.

363
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,540
Now here's an experiment.

364
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:30,780
Take a look at this shop that sells handbags and take a look at this one.

365
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:36,790
Now how much are you willing to pay for a handbag from this shop versus this one.

366
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:41,330
Now this is really a use case for white space.

367
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:45,030
A lot of luxury shops, luxury designer stores,

368
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:53,850
one of their simplest tools is just injecting white space around their products, space things out and it

369
00:07:53,850 --> 00:08:00,690
makes everything suddenly look a lot more expensive. Whereas when you have everything all tightly crammed

370
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:06,120
together and you have a lot of product on show, it makes it look like it's some sort of discount store.

371
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:12,030
And the same principle applies when it comes to digital design as well.

372
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:15,290
Let's say you have an ad for noise cancelling headphones.

373
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:21,490
If you have loads of things on screen, there's "New", "Only $20", "100% noise cancellation".

374
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:28,590
It makes the product look really cheap. Whereas if you injected some white space, all of a sudden it looks

375
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:35,370
like Apple made it right? Just by adding that space around each element on the screen

376
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:41,090
you can make your design a lot more minimalist and at the same time elevate it.

377
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:46,650
Now the last thing on User Interface design I want to talk about and probably the most important is

378
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:49,170
design for your audience.

379
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:53,110
A lot of things I've said, including not using comic-sans,

380
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,830
it really depends on your audience.

381
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:00,810
Let's say you're designing a children's concert poster, the one on the right looks like something that

382
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:06,530
children might actually want to go to. The one on the left looks a bit like a funeral advertisement.

383
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:15,030
It's so serious. It's so black and white and it's so severe looking that no child is kind of want to

384
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,290
go to that concert.

385
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,360
So think about your audience.

386
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:25,380
Think about what would appeal to them and what's important to convey to them. That it's going to be a

387
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:32,530
fun concert or that it's going to be boring adults who are going to be reading newspapers and some sort

388
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:39,480
of classical band in the background. When you're designing websites design it for your audience even

389
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,940
if it's something a little bit messier, a little bit bolder in terms of color, as long as it fits your

390
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,360
audience and that's perfectly fine.

391
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:54,300
So have the flexibility in your design so that you're not just creating one style all the time. You're

392
00:09:54,300 --> 00:10:00,870
creating one style for a particular audience like teenagers who want to buy clothes and you're creating

393
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:06,990
a different style for people who want to buy and sell cryptocurrency or have a medical website.

394
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:14,100
So the flexibility in your design skills is really important when it comes to User Interface design.

395
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:22,350
But keep in mind those five things: hierarchy, layout, alignment, white space and your audience and you'll

396
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:27,420
be well on the way to creating more beautiful user interfaces for your websites.


397
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:08,039
Now, so far we've talked about the three pillars of web design: Color Theory, Typography, User Interface

398
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:13,600
design and now I want to talk about the last pillar, User Experience design.

399
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:19,520
Now a lot of people often get confused about what exactly is UX or User Experience?

400
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:27,720
And one of the best ways I've heard it explained is through the story of the renovation of a college.

401
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:35,640
So this is a picture of Reed College in the US and let's just use it as our imaginary backdrop.

402
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,550
So this college decided that it needed to undergo serious renovation. Tearing down the buildings, building

403
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,500
new ones and completely reform the campus.

404
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:51,660
So they invited this well-known architect who is very respected in his field.

405
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,540
He came and he did a great job with all the buildings and the provost was really really happy.

406
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,240
He was like "This looks great."

407
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,710
But he had one question.

408
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:10,470
"Hey Mr. Architect. It seemed like you've just left lawn across the entire campus. Where are all the path that

409
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,090
people are going to walk on to get between the buildings?" At this point

410
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:20,810
the architect says "Don't worry. I'll come back in a year and all will be revealed."

411
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:28,320
So in a year the paths where people need to naturally walk becomes trotted down and the grass gets worn

412
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,540
down revealing these paths that people need.

413
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:37,790
And it's at this point when the architect actually lays down all the tiles and paves these paths.

414
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:43,230
So this is kind of the difference between user experience and design. Design

415
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:49,820
we often think of having an aesthetic, what we think looks good and enforcing that on the user.

416
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,000
Now user experience is meant to be invisible.

417
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,790
If you have a good experience with a website it's meant to be unobtrusive and it just lets you do your

418
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:05,490
thing and it feels like as if everything is easy and everything is effortless.

419
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,690
So this is what we're aiming for.

420
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,120
And in order to do that we have to think about again five things.

421
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:21,000
The first is simplicity. Keeping things simple is always better than making it more complex or more cluttered.

422
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,570
So this is a website called Sina and it's one of the biggest News websites in China.

423
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:33,320
Now every time I look at it though I get a headache because it is just so dense.

424
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:39,030
There are so many links and my brain gets overwhelmed and I say "Nope, can't do it."

425
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,270
So take a look at this alternative.

426
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,630
This is Monocle, which is also a News website.

427
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:51,510
But look at how they've managed to chop up the content, provides some interest for the eyes.

428
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:55,290
There's a little bit of dialogue, some images, some videos, a little bit of text.

429
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,330
It's never overwhelming.

430
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,960
And with that consistent color scheme and typography, it's really delightful to actually read rather

431
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:09,300
than this experience of sort of hurting your eyes with design.

432
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,720
This is a much nicer user experience because it's simple.

433
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:18,700
So whenever you're having to choose, should I make it more complex or should I make it more simple,

434
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,720
always try to pare it down.

435
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,710
The second point is consistency.

436
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:31,320
Keep your designs consistent but also keep the functionality of your product consistent.

437
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,140
So here's an example.

438
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:42,520
This is the webpage for Xfinity. Xfinity is a really big communications company in the US and they

439
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:48,130
are responsible for various things like providing TV and providing internet.

440
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:52,090
Here are three screenshots from various parts of their website.

441
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,440
One is their home page,

442
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,320
the second is their TV offerings and the last one is their News site.

443
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:04,420
And if you take a look at the top navigation bar not only do you see that they've changed up the design

444
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:08,360
of the navigation bar between the different parts of their website,

445
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,160
they also made it work a little bit differently.

446
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:15,460
The buttons are not all in the same place, the search bar moves around.

447
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:21,880
And that inconsistency means that a user is going to be confused when they go from one part of the website

448
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,850
to another, having to re-learn how to use your website.

449
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:31,210
If you think about the target audience of this company Xfinity, a lot of them are going to be a little

450
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,680
bit older right?

451
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,530
And having this inconsistent functionality and inconsistent design will really make those users have

452
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,440
a bad experience with this website.

453
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,270
Now the next thing to think about when you're designing your website is to take into account people's

454
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,770
reading patterns.

455
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:54,020
Now they've looked at how human eyes track a webpage and which parts they look at when they're browsing.

456
00:04:54,190 --> 00:05:00,580
And one of the most common reading patterns is what's called the F-pattern where the eye starts at the

457
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:05,370
top left of the corner and then it tracks the right and then it flips back again

458
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,360
browsing down the left gutter.

459
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:14,020
So you have often things like bullet points or pictures or icons, buttons, they're all on the left.

460
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:17,280
So you can design for this by using the F-layout.

461
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:24,490
So have the most important parts of your content on the left gutter, have the logo at the top and have

462
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,800
everything follow this pattern.

463
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,340
For example like this website for Bigcommerce.

464
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:35,560
See how the eye is being naturally accommodated going from left to right.

465
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:42,610
Now another really common pattern for reading is the Z-pattern where our eyes go from left to right and then

466
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,370
zigzagging down all the way the website.

467
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,670
Now this of course depends on the type of website.

468
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,540
So you have something that's more sparse with more video content or if somebody is trying to browse

469
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,440
a website a little bit faster,

470
00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:01,050
you see them using this layout. And this layout is used pretty famously in the Facebook website

471
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:05,520
using that Z-pattern to accommodate for people's natural reading pattern.

472
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,810
So have a think about this. Have a think about how people naturally looks at the page and place your

473
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:16,680
content in that pattern to make it easier for people who are using your website.

474
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:21,760
Now in today's day and age, it's really important to think about All Platform Design.

475
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:27,330
It's not enough anymore to just design a website that's meant to go into a desktop computer.

476
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,700
Instead you have to think about mobile as well.

477
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:37,990
So having a website that scales up nicely onto mobile, what we call mobile responsive, is really important.

478
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:45,070
You don't want a big website that's designed to take up a landscape kind of screen to be crammed into

479
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:45,860
a phone

480
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,700
that's actually more like a portrait shape.

481
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,110
This looks really bad.

482
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:55,500
It's very hard to read the individual links and, more often than not, my fingers are actually too big to tap

483
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,680
onto the length that I want.

484
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,700
So this is a really bad user experience.

485
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,220
Now this can happen the opposite way as well.

486
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:10,030
So a design that looks much better on mobile but then when it's rendered on a desktop with a wide kind

487
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:14,550
of screen, it doesn't use up enough of the screen real estate. For example,

488
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,270
this is the Facebook latest redesign of their website.

489
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:23,980
And you've got all of this empty space that's not being used at all and everything is crammed into the

490
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:24,750
middle.

491
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:31,260
This is not very efficient. So have a think about how you're using the available space and make sure

492
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:39,210
that your website rearranges itself when it's being rendered on a portrait smaller screen vs. a larger

493
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:46,980
desktop screen. And try to avoid one of my pet peeves in terms of design which is having so many banners

494
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:53,010
on your website that show up on the mobile version that your content becomes impossibly small.

495
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:57,480
And even when you're scrolling it's like you're scrolling it on an Apple Watch or something.

496
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:03,360
Whereas all of this extra content is taken up by warnings and banners and cookies and it's just not

497
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,590
a very good user experience.

498
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,830
But on the other hand, don't go crazy either.

499
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:15,870
Don't make your entire website just one part like a picture or a piece of text scaling it up massively

500
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:21,960
like this is also very very awkward because then I have to just keep scrolling until forever before

501
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,080
I can actually read and take in all of the content.

502
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,630
So strike a happy medium.

503
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,430
And most importantly test, test, test.

504
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,820
Give it to other users.

505
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,960
You can employ professional testers to try out your website and give you feedback.

506
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:40,799
Now if you can't afford that, just use your family and friends. And bake some cookies for them,

507
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:46,800
get them to test out your website and start getting some feedback on how you can improve the design.

508
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,840
Now finally we've talked a lot about user experience and how to get people to have a good time.

509
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:57,900
Now some designers though use the knowledge they have about human psychology and User Interface and

510
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:04,670
User Experience design to do bad things.

511
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:13,410
And in the design world, we call these dark patterns. So patterns which get a user to perform an action

512
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:17,790
or behavior that is beneficial to the company or the designer

513
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,960
but it's not necessarily what the user wants.

514
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:25,450
And this I would say is another form of bad user experience.

515
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,510
So let me give you some examples.

516
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:32,790
This is a real life example. Let's say that you walked into Waitrose which is a big supermarket in the

517
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:35,880
UK and you bought yourself a sandwich.

518
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:40,560
Now when you look at it at the point when you're buying it, it looks like this sandwich is going to be

519
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,510
full length from edge to edge

520
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,410
right?

521
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:49,320
But then when you rip open the packaging you're disappointed when you find that actually all that's

522
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:55,540
in the middle is just air and your sandwich turns out to be a lot smaller than you initially thought.

523
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,910
It is the worst feeling in the world.

524
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,840
This is a feeling that I can't stand when my food suddenly gets reduced in size.

525
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:07,770
It's like as if somebody came along and took food out of your plate. In the digital world,

526
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:13,770
people do the same thing. The same kind of trickery that's meant to get you to perform an action that

527
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:20,430
you don't necessarily want and you end up feeling really disappointed and really upset. With Amazon every

528
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,110
single time

529
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,550
I have to re-click the free delivery button which I've earned by buying so much product from them.

530
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:32,310
But they still try to trick you using the things that we've learned about hierarchy

531
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:39,060
for example. Here the button that makes the more money "Express delivery" is highlighted in orange.

532
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,860
It pops out a lot more.

533
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,000
It's a lot more likely that you'll want to click on it.

534
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:50,880
But in all likelihood, you're probably happy with just normal delivery and you're now tricked into paying

535
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,040
more for this delivery.

536
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,260
Now here's another example

537
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,230
that's actually true the evil.

538
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,410
This is a Snapchat ad for some shoes.

539
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:08,340
But what the designer has cleverly done on the advertising is they've placed a one pixel curved line

540
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:15,090
on this ad which makes it kind of look a bit like a hair is on your screen. But when you go into that

541
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:19,140
screen and you try to get rid of that piece of hair, well you've tapped on an avenue.

542
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:26,550
So the ad takes you to the website and the advertisers make money off each click.

543
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:32,020
And this is truly a dog pattern because it's just tricking you to do something you didn't want to.

544
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:37,770
Whereas good design is about helping people do what they want to do and giving them a good experience

545
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,400
while they're at it.

546
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:47,250
Now the king of dog patterns is RyanAir and it's a low cost airline in Europe which is really known for

547
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,720
sort of charging you for every single little thing.

548
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:55,880
I wouldn't be surprised if tomorrow they suddenly charged you for using the toilet on the plane.

549
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:03,150
But here's what the website looks like when you tried to buy an airplane ticket. In order to buy your

550
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:08,370
airplane ticket you have to go through all of these extra add ons including saying "No I don't want to

551
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:13,920
buy travel insurance." But look at how they've hidden it inside this big dropdown list and it's not even

552
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,170
at the beginning of the list.

553
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,920
It's actually sorted alphabetically below Denmark for some reason.

554
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:23,650
And this just makes it so much harder for you to find that option

555
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,910
and for you to actually accidentally end up buying travel insurance.

556
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:34,930
Now the final example and probably one of the dog patterns I dislike the most is these checkboxes. You

557
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,660
know right below you filled in a form,

558
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:42,130
you get these checkboxes and sometimes the wording is so confusing that I really don't know what I'm

559
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:43,120
signing up for.

560
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:49,720
Like this one: If you would like us to no longer continue to stop not sending you special deals and offers

561
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:53,150
every week, please indicate you are inclined to yes

562
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:57,440
by not checking the box. I have no idea what clicking that box does.

563
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,160
I really just... I don't know.

564
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:00,490
I might click it, I might not.

565
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:06,490
I don't know what it does. But it's horribly confusing and it's not a good user experience at all.

566
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:10,440
I will bet you that after I sign up I'm never going to come back to this website again

567
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,390
right?

568
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:13,210
Are you with me? Now

569
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,850
we've seen what good websites look like.

570
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:18,130
We've seen what bad websites look like.

571
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,650
We've even seen what evil websites look like.

572
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:27,520
But it's time to put our knowledge to the test by designing our own website from scratch and applying

573
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,460
these four pillars of web design to this project.

574
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:36,190
So have a think about what you've learned so far and head over to the next lesson where we're going

575
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,860
to design a hotel website from scratch.


576
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:07,410
Now that we've learned about some of the principles of web design such as Color Theory, Typography, User

577
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:14,730
Interface design and User Experience design, the four pillars, it's time to apply what we've learned and

578
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,040
build a design together.

579
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:23,220
Now there's a website called Daily UI which gives you a task to design every day for 100 days.

580
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:29,610
It's free to sign up and it's something that really does improve designing skills by just that repeated

581
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,060
practice.

582
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:37,070
Now if you take a look at a website called Collect UI you can see they've collected together all the

583
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:43,290
designers attempts at designing each of these daily challenges and you can see examples what each of

584
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,800
these challenges are.

585
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:52,810
For example, anything from creating a sign up screen to a flight website to a hotel booking website.

586
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:59,630
So we're going to take some of these ideas as inspiration and create our own website design

587
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:05,190
applying the four pillars that we've learned in this module. The first thing I want you to do is head

588
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,980
over to a website called canva.com.

589
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:14,430
Now this is a online graphics editing program and you don't have to download anything and it's completely

590
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,660
free to sign up.

591
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:20,580
So sign up for a new account and then go ahead and create a new design.

592
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:27,720
So we're going to pick custom dimensions and I'm going to choose 1400 pixels by 800 pixels high.

593
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:33,750
Once we're inside our design we're going to take this as the first screen that the user sees in our

594
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:34,740
website.

595
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,270
And then when they scroll down they'll see the next page and then they scroll down and see the final

596
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,350
part of our website.

597
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:44,060
So let's design the first title screen.

598
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:50,780
Now I'm going to choose this free template which gives me a backdrop already but I'm actually just going

599
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:55,380
to use it for some texture. I quite like the way that this pattern looks.

600
00:01:55,410 --> 00:02:00,030
So I'm going to apply the pattern and then I'm going to change the background.

601
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,080
Now I think the background looks a little bit bland with just a single color.

602
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:12,600
So I'm going to choose a photo instead and I'm going to search for a beach, like this one.

603
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:18,960
So now that I've got my image I'm going to drag it out so that it's sized as large as it needs to be.

604
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:25,200
So going all the way to each of the edges. And then I'm going to reposition it so that it fills up the

605
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,200
entire screen. Like this.

606
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,500
So now I have a background image, some sort of texture on it

607
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,810
and I can go to the elements to keep adding to this design.

608
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,920
Let's take a look at some of the gradients here.

609
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,930
And I'm going to pick something that'll fit in with this theme.

610
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,590
Now, of course, how you design this is completely up to you.

611
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:52,710
And I'm just providing an example of how I go through this process of designing.

612
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,510
So now I've got a circle here.

613
00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:02,670
I'm going to add some more shapes maybe a square of some sort. We can click on see all to see all the

614
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:03,870
other ones.

615
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:12,270
And then I'm going to put a square which I'm going to make it so that it goes right to the end of each

616
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,340
of the sites.

617
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:19,310
So here and then we're going to make it line up with the center of the circle roughly like this.

618
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:23,460
And let's just change that color to white.

619
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:29,080
Now we have this nice white border, some abstract shapes and patterns and an image.

620
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:34,530
Now I'm going to add a heading text. This heading text is going to be the name of our hotel.

621
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:41,140
After all we're designing a website for this unknown Hotel which I'll call "A Hotel".

622
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:49,410
A really easy way of making something look authoritative and like it's been around forever is by changing

623
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:52,170
the typeface to a Serif typeface.

624
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:58,470
So I'm going to highlight this font and I'm going to click the dropdown and find a serif typeface like

625
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,790
this one cardo.

626
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,870
And notice how instantly our hotel looks a lot more established like it's been around for longer.

627
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,530
Now I'm going to change the color of this also to white.

628
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:16,709
So notice how we're starting to establish a color palette of greens and turquoise and blue and white.

629
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:26,870
And we're going to increase the font size to maybe something really large like 120 or 144. And

630
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,070
I'm going to change this so that it's all caps like so.

631
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,050
So that's actually a little bit too big

632
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:41,360
so let's drop it down a notch. And I can increase the spacing of the letters to again make it look more

633
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,450
fancy, more expensive and more authoritative.

634
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:51,710
Here's the name of our hotel, A Hotel,  centered in this box.

635
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:57,400
And now I'm ready to add a subheading and my subheading is going to be some sort of tagline

636
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,560
right?

637
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:05,020
And I'm going to go with something really obnoxious like "Lose Yourself to find yourself".

638
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,070
I feel like I'm ready to open a hotel tomorrow.

639
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:17,170
Let's Now contrast this serif typeface for the title with a San-Serif sort of body or subtitle.

640
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:20,010
And this is what we learned about in the typography section.

641
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:22,260
It creates contrast in the design.

642
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:28,820
So I'm going to pick this Glacial indifference typeface and I'm again going to choose white and then

643
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:34,590
make both these lines left-aligned so that I can align them to the same position.

644
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:40,700
And that is how when you drag elements around on canvas it automatically gives you these alignment grids

645
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:46,670
so that you can more easily position it so that they are actually all aligned together.

646
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,710
And notice how big a difference that looks

647
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:54,190
just having it off alignment and then on alignment. It's suddenly just looks a lot more proper

648
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:58,170
right? Now I'm more or less done with my title page.

649
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:04,830
I'm going to move on to the next one which is going to be a page for selling the features of the hotel.

650
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:11,330
Let's start off by adding some images. And I've got some that I've already found before.

651
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:18,290
I've got a picture of a bedroom which I'm going to make it a little bit smaller like so and then I've

652
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:21,950
got a picture of a breakfast of some sort.

653
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,290
So you've got food at this hotel.

654
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:25,460
You're not going to starve.

655
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,770
That's pretty important for people to know.

656
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:33,510
And I'm going to size it so that it's actually the same size as the other one.

657
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,930
So I'm just going to put it on top.

658
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,000
Now the last one is going to be a pool.

659
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,610
So you've also got a pool.

660
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,830
You don't get bored if it gets too hot.

661
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,650
You can always just go into the pool.

662
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,780
This is turning out to be a great hotel

663
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,690
by the way, I really want to stay here.

664
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:52,600
Now the goal of our features page is to have three images which are probably going to be about the same

665
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,470
size.

666
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:59,920
So I'm actually going to need to crop this last photo so that I get rid of maybe a little bit of this

667
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:05,520
right edge but have it just about the same size as my other photos.

668
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,780
And now I need to resize each of these photos so that it actually can fit onto this page.

669
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,850
So I'm just going to throw them one on top of the other and resize them

670
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,670
so they're all the same size.

671
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:21,210
And now I can place them around this web page.

672
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:25,730
So when you move towards the edge of each page you can see this grid show up.

673
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:29,500
So I'm going to line up the left with the left side of the grid the right with the right side of the

674
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,410
grid and the middle right in the middle.

675
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:39,160
So now these three are evenly spaced apart and I can now add some more design features to it because

676
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,430
it's looking a little bit bland just as photos.

677
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:48,180
Now one of the easiest things to make photos look nice is to just jazz it up with a frame.

678
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,440
Now because all hotel is very modern, it's contemporary,

679
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,210
it's been featured in Vogue,

680
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:57,820
I want to make sure that the framing also looks equally contemporary.

681
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:04,780
So I'm going to find a circle and I'm going to put this circle around this square image which is going

682
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:11,590
to make it look quite nice and contemporary. And then I'm going to give it a background color like that.

683
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:14,520
And we've now framed our picture.

684
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:22,150
So now, all I have to do is just copy it and put it onto all the other images like so.

685
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,490
And now I've got three features.

686
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,830
You've got a bed, you've got food, you've got pool.

687
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:31,650
What more do you want? The next part is probably going to be some sort of explainer

688
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,210
right?

689
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:39,789
So add a subheading of these sections and the subheading is going to be something like you get beautiful

690
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:45,160
food, you have beautiful rooms and you have a beautiful pool.

691
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:50,070
So three things that we've got. And I'm going to left-align

692
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:59,500
each of these again so that I can make it aligned with the left edge of each of the pictures like this.

693
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:07,240
So all three of these pieces of text are on the same horizontal level and they're also vertically aligned

694
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,360
with the start of each image.

695
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:16,240
Now each of these will need to be designed so that they have the same typeface as what we had in the

696
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,370
title page so that it's consistent

697
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:18,950
right?

698
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:21,670
We're reflecting the same thing that we saw before.

699
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:29,890
So I'm gonna change that again to Glacial indifference and do the same for all three bits of text.

700
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:36,370
And now we can afford to increase the spacing in the text a little bit to make it look a little bit

701
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:41,270
more roomy. So I think I had 18

702
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:46,940
on the other one so I'm going to put 18 here as well and 18 here as well.

703
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:49,350
There we go.

704
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:55,760
So we've got all three bits of text and now all we need is just a little bit of body text. For the bod

705
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,200
text

706
00:09:56,210 --> 00:10:04,460
I'm going to use a Lorem Ipsum. So I'm going to use one of these generators and just get some text generated

707
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:12,200
and I'm going to copy a little bit of it and put it into my design. Replace that text with this

708
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,420
and that's a little bit too much.

709
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:22,280
So let's make it a bit smaller. And we're going to have some text which is going to go just below this

710
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,540
section.

711
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,850
So it's still a little bit too much.

712
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:28,730
Let's get rid of the last sentence. That looks pretty good.

713
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:31,340
Now again we want to keep our design consistent.

714
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:37,190
So we're going to make sure it's again left aligned using the same font as before.

715
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:44,360
And we've now got a bit of body text which I'm going to further style by changing the color of each

716
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,310
of these.

717
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:53,700
So I want to go for maybe like a dark-grayish like one of these and the same for the body text.

718
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,750
That way it doesn't sort of stand out so much.

719
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,350
And I'm going to copy this

720
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:03,620
so that I put it on all of the other features.

721
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,410
Notice the alignment here.

722
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:08,390
I've got all the pictures aligned with each other,

723
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:11,570
all of these circles center-aligned with each picture,

724
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:17,610
I've got all the text lined along the left and this just makes the design look a lot tighter

725
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,910
and a lot more consistent.

726
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:25,330
And notice how with the layout I've tried to keep it interesting by having some pictures that break

727
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:31,130
up the text and making sure that each body of text is not overwhelming. It's not too long

728
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,570
like a big long sentence.

729
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:36,440
But instead it's short enough to be easily read quickly.

730
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:40,790
Now, the other thing you'll notice is that there's a degree of hierarchy that's being established here

731
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,450
right?

732
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:46,630
Clearly the thing that I really want people to know is that my hotel is called A Hotel.

733
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:51,800
But in addition, I've also got beautiful food being more important than the body text

734
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,640
that explains that paragraph.

735
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:59,750
And each of these images also being more important because, let's face it, most people look at the pictures

736
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,100
and don't read anything right?

737
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,930
So that's our second part of the website

738
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:03,530
done.

739
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,270
And we're now onto the last part which is going to be the contact page.

740
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:15,080
So this contact page I'm again going to search for maybe a photo of something that's quite fashionable,

741
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,530
contemporary, tropical.

742
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:21,020
Maybe we can just find a picture of a pineapple.

743
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:24,130
And this one looks pretty good.

744
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:30,320
Let's go ahead and position this photo so that it's the same size as the design.

745
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,330
And now I can move it up so that only the bottom shows up my pineapples.

746
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,080
So there we go.

747
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:43,100
We've got 1, 2 and 3 and the last part is just a contact me page. The contact me page is also

748
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,280
going to need some titled text.

749
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:47,360
Let's just call that Stay.

750
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,940
So when they want to stay they can take a look at this section. And we're going to again copy this style

751
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:57,510
that we had from before so that we can actually replicate it down here

752
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:00,830
and we keep our design again consistent.

753
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:06,800
It has the same theme, the same color palette, the same typography.

754
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:13,280
This is a little bit too big though. So let's make it a bit smaller so it fits onto this page.

755
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:19,100
And again I'm going to be consistent with our geometric shapes which is lending that sort of modern

756
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:23,830
feel. I've got a sort of rectangle, a circle, more circles.

757
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:31,880
So let's pick another shape from here. Maybe some sort of a hexagon. That looks pretty good.

758
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,260
Let's add the hexagon,

759
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:43,490
make it a bit smaller, we can maybe move our pineapples down a bit and change this so that it's white

760
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:47,930
and make it even a bit smaller.

761
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,000
I think something like that would do quite well.

762
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:57,380
So now the final thing I want to add is some sort of mailing address, email address, phone number, which

763
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:02,200
is going to go in here and it's going to be nicely aligned with this word stay.

764
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:10,190
So let's go ahead and take this word and make it right aligned so that this line pops up when I try

765
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:16,810
to align it like so and let's just make sure that it actually still fits in.

766
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:23,450
So maybe we have to move this text up a little bit, reduce the spacing a little.

767
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:29,210
I think a lot of times you do have to play around with your design just so that it starts looking good

768
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,040
to you.

769
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:35,240
You might have to shift things a little bit and be flexible with those rules that we've talked about.

770
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:43,610
So now all we need to make sure is that the word is right-aligned and our text is also right-aligned

771
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,240
so that we can actually line them up together so that they actually look like they're on the same vertical

772
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,830
alignment.

773
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:59,720
Now, if we can just mess around with the size of the hexagon and make sure that everything is still within

774
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:05,960
the hexagon and we've pretty much finished our design now. What did that take? Maybe 20 minutes. And

775
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:11,330
we managed to apply a lot of things that we've learned from User Interface design or User Experience

776
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:19,700
design, Color Theory and Typography to create this 3-page very modern looking website for A Hotel.

777
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:26,000
So at this point, there's a really cool feature in Canva which lets you just publish the website.

778
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:33,830
So if you click on this publish button and you scroll all the way down and you click on website then

779
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:40,820
you can actually select the Web style as standard and then open this as an actual web page.

780
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:46,100
Notice how it's placed my three pages together into an actual web page

781
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:51,390
and I can scroll down and also navigate to it through the navigation bar.

782
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,920
Now of course we don't have mobile optimization,

783
00:15:53,930 --> 00:16:01,130
we don't have any code that has any functionality, we can't add javascript to it. But at least we can quickly

784
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:06,440
throw up a design, visualize it and share it with other people to see what they think.

785
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:11,050
And this is probably one of the best ways of building up your design muscle.

786
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:17,510
Just practicing again and again until you get to a point where pretty much unanimously everybody thinks

787
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:22,520
that your design looks great and people start asking you to actually build websites for them.

788
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,940
So study a lot of the websites that you come across,

789
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:30,320
the ones that you think look really good. And think about what makes them good and then try to take some

790
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:37,700
of those aspects along with everything you've learned in these lessons to create designs that humans

791
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:38,840
love.

792
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:47,370
So I hope you'll take a moment now to pause the video and have a go at creating your own hotel website.

793
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:54,020
So use the same tools that you saw me use on Canva and try to design a slightly different type of hotel.

794
00:16:54,020 --> 00:17:00,500
What if it had to be a more traditional hotel that was around the time of Henry the 8th or something? It's

795
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:07,200
like some really old hotel and they want to show how decadent they are, how glamorous they are, and trying

796
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,089
to design a different type of website.

797
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:16,369
So pause the video, give that a go and then try to apply everything you've learned in this module into

798
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,579
that design.

799
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:24,140
And once you've created your design share this link that you can see at the top of Canva so that we

800
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:28,950
can all see your design and we can comment on how beautiful it looks.

801
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,670
So have a go at doing that and make sure that you let us know what it looks like in the comments below

802
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:39,990
and have fun doing it. Now I hope you really enjoyed this module on web design.

803
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,550
It's a little bit different from what you've been used to so far.

804
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:48,530
There's no coding in this module but instead we tried to get you to think about all of the design principles

805
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:54,380
that actually ends up creating beautiful websites, websites that people will love. And hopefully

806
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:59,150
you'll take these pillars and this knowledge through the next time you build your product or you build

807
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:06,110
your website and you'll apply it alongside with your code so that you have beautiful features and beautiful

808
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,450
interface.

809
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:12,440
Now once you've created your own designs and you've shared it with us then it's time to get back to

810
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,310
the coding and 

811
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:18,570
we're going to continue tackling more web development. So for all of that and more,

812
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,280
I'll see you there.
