00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:05,230
Hey, guys, well done for achieving a big milestone.

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:10,590
Now here's a quick tip about the upcoming projects and lessons.

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,460
Now you might look ahead and you might see, oh, what's going on?

4
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,260
There's no step by step guidance.

5
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,840
There's no solution code.

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,210
What's happening here?

7
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:27,730
Now, what I want you to be able to do after you complete this course is to have achieved all of the

8
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:32,229
skills that you need to be able to get a job as a python developer.

9
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:38,920
And one of the most important things you need to be able to demonstrate is that you can write your own

10
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:45,220
code, not code from a tutorial, not code that I've guided you through, but code that you actually

11
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,080
thought about, that you wrote.

12
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,220
So we're going to help you to build your portfolio in the upcoming section.

13
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:59,230
I've created some project ideas that are usually quite good when it comes to interviews.

14
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:06,970
And your job is to use everything that you've learned, plus research plus Googling plus reviewing

15
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:12,420
some lessons to create those projects and write entirely your code.

16
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,730
But what this means is that you can copyright your code, you can build it out into a real business,

17
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:25,120
you can put it into your portfolio or put it onto GitHub and demonstrate at your next interview that

18
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,270
you can create your own projects without the help of somebody else.

19
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:36,100
So I've taught courses on Web development, on iOS development, and I've often seen students come to

20
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:43,120
job interviews with a project that I'm like, "Oh, I think I know that I wrote the code for that."

21
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:49,350
Or you see online where people have the same project over and over again with exactly the same code.

22
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:53,140
This is what you're going to avoid by going that extra step.

23
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,640
Now, I'm not saying it's easy.

24
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,190
It's going to be really hard, but this is how you learn and this is how you progress as a developer.

25
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,280
In this course, I want it to be a safe space for you.

26
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:10,810
I want it to be a place where you can play, you can explore, you can fail without any repercussions,

27
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:15,220
because we're all here to support you on your journey.

28
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,120
So don't worry if you can't do something, don't worry

29
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,530
if you get it wrong,

30
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:25,360
don't worry if it doesn't look great, just share your code and we'll give you feedback and we're going

31
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,280
to get you to that place where you want to be. But you have to be willing to try as well.

32
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:35,380
So I hope you're going to succeed in the coming lessons and I definitely hope you're going to give it

33
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:38,650
a go because it is so important for your development.

34
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,930
So here's good luck to you.

35
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,380
And remember, as always, I believe in you.
