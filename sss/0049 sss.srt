00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:04,500
Hey guys, welcome to Day 49 of 100 Days of Code.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,960
We're almost halfway and today we've got a really special project for you.

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:10,500
Now,

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,500
I know a lot of you guys are learning Programming to get a new job or change the

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,660
area in which you work,

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,110
and basically just find better opportunities for yourself.

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:27,000
So today's project is going to test what you've learned about how to work with

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,833
selenium,

9
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:32,310
and we're going to be building an automated job application bot.

10
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,480
This is going to put all the skills that we've learned yesterday into use

11
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,740
where we get selenium web driver to drive a browser

12
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,680
to open up a website and apply for jobs.

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,090
So applying jobs can be quite tedious working through each of the

14
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:48,930
applications,

15
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,960
filling in the required details and hoping that your application stands out.

16
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:00,300
So let's see if we can make this easier for ourselves by automating the process.

17
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,519
Now, one of the ways that a lot of people apply for jobs is on LinkedIn.

18
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,600
So they have this section called jobs. And when you go there,

19
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,660
you can search for the kind of jobs you're looking for,

20
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,560
where you're looking to work, you can even add in filters

21
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,880
like show remote jobs only where you can work from anywhere in the world.

22
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,840
And they've also got this really neat feature called easy apply.

23
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,640
And all you have to do is just to click on this button, easy apply,

24
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:32,910
fill in any of the fields that you haven't filled in before

25
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,370
and then just click submit application.

26
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,210
Some applications are a little bit more complicated than this.

27
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,550
This is the simplest format. Now,

28
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:45,360
in order to actually show you the whole process without messing with anybody

29
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,890
else's job applications,

30
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,330
I decided to create a job posting on LinkedIn from our own company.

31
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,430
So we're currently looking for a marketing intern to help us launch courses.

32
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,170
And when I click on this job, you can see this easy apply button show up.

33
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,000
So if I click on easy apply and I fill in my dummy phone number,

34
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,520
then I click on next.

35
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,910
Then I can include a resume.

36
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,930
Now the resume comes from your settings.

37
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,960
So if you go to your settings and privacy and you go to job seeking preferences

38
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:26,370
then here, you can actually already pre-upload your resume.

39
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,060
Once you've done that, then when you click easy apply,

40
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,070
you'll see the resume already uploaded. So we don't even have to do that

41
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,080
using our bot. Finally,

42
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,080
we click review and we're ready to go ahead and send and submit our application.

43
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,130
So that's how easy it is to submit our application

44
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,080
and you can see that there's only four or five steps that we need to automate in

45
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,880
order to apply for a job. That's the project for today

46
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,990
and I hope you're as excited as I am to tackle this project.

47
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,770
And you might even see a practical use for it in the future.

48
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:09,180
Once you're ready, head over to the next lesson where you'll find step by step

49
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,640
instructions on how to complete this project.
